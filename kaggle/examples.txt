im feeling rather rotten so im not very ambitious right now
im updating my blog because i feel shitty
i cant walk into a shop anywhere where i do not feel uncomfortable
i don t feel particularly agitated
i felt anger when at the end of a telephone call
i am feeling outraged it shows everywhere
i just feel extremely comfortable with the group of people that i dont even need to hide myself
i feel a little mellow today
